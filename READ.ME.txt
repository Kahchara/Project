This is a tool for performing a brute force attack against an SSH server. It uses the python library called paramiko to facilitate the attempted authentications.
It works by attempting to log into an SSH server with a chosen username and a list of passwords.
This program can be run in the terminal by typing """python SSH.py --host 1.1.1.1 --username XXXX --password-list XXXX.txt"""
The host flag is the IP-adress that is being targeted
The username is the username that is being attempted, such as admin
The password-list is the name of the document containing all the passwords to be attmempted with the username. 
(NOTE: The password-list should have a singel password on each row, see pass_example.txt for a demostration)
